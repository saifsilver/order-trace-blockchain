# Blockchain Application for Order and Delivery Management

This is a simple blockchain application built with Node.js and Express.js for managing orders and deliveries. It uses Proof of Work (PoW) for securing transactions and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.

## Features

- Create and manage orders with customer details and product information.
- Track delivery status and manage delivery transactions.
- Implement Proof of Work (PoW) for securing transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain.
- View the entire blockchain to verify the history of transactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-order-delivery.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-order-delivery
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /blockchain`: View the entire blockchain.
- `POST /order`: Create a new order.
- `POST /delivery`: Create a new delivery transaction.
- `GET /mine`: Mine pending transactions and add them to the blockchain.

## Usage

### Creating an Order

To create a new order, send a POST request to `/order` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "products": [
    { "name": "Product A", "qty": 2 },
    { "name": "Product B", "qty": 3 }
  ],
  "customer": { "name": "Alice", "address": "123 Main St" }
}
```

### Creating a Delivery Transaction

To create a new delivery transaction, send a POST request to `/delivery` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "orderId": "1",
  "deliveryId": "D1",
  "status": "In Transit",
  "deliveryPerson": "John Doe"
}
```

### Mining Pending Transactions

To mine pending transactions and add them to the blockchain, send a GET request to `/mine`.
